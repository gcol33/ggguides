\title{Horizontally Align Guides Across Plots}
\usage{
align_guides_h(x, guides = c("collect", "keep"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A patchwork object created by combining ggplot2 plots.}

\item{guides}{How to handle guides. Either \code{"collect"} to combine into a
single legend (default), or \code{"keep"} to maintain separate legends while
ensuring they align.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object with aligned guide areas.
}
\description{
Ensures that guide (legend) areas align horizontally across multiple plots
in a composition. This is useful when you have side-by-side or stacked plots
and want their legends to be visually aligned.
}
\details{
This function works by applying patchwork's axis alignment features which
indirectly ensure that legend areas have consistent positioning. When
\code{guides = "collect"}, legends are also merged.

For cowplot: Horizontal alignment in cowplot requires manual use of
\code{\link[cowplot]{align_plots}} with \code{align = "h"}. This function
does not directly support cowplot objects.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# Two plots with different y-axis label widths
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Weight")
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "A very long y-axis label")

# Align horizontally with collected legend
align_guides_h(p1 / p2)

# Keep separate legends but aligned
align_guides_h(p1 / p2, guides = "keep")
