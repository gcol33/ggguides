\title{Collect Legends from Patchwork Compositions}
\usage{
collect_legends(
  x,
  position = c("right", "left", "bottom", "top"),
  span = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A patchwork object created by combining ggplot2 plots with
operators like \code{|}, \code{/}, or \code{+}.}

\item{position}{Where to place the collected legends. One of \code{"right"}
(default), \code{"left"}, \code{"bottom"}, or \code{"top"}.}

\item{span}{Logical or integer vector. If \code{TRUE}, the legend will span
the full height (for left/right) or width (for top/bottom). If an integer
vector (e.g., \code{c(1, 2)} or \code{1:2}), the legend spans only those
rows/columns. Default is \code{FALSE}. When not \code{FALSE}, returns a
gtable instead of a patchwork object.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object with legends collected, or a gtable if
\code{span} is not \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Collects legends from multiple plots in a patchwork composition into a single
legend area. This is a convenience wrapper around patchwork's guide
collection functionality.
}
\details{
This function requires the patchwork package. If patchwork is not installed,
an informative error is raised.

When \code{span = TRUE}, the function converts the patchwork to a gtable
and modifies the legend cell to span all rows (for right/left positions) or
all columns (for top/bottom positions). This addresses the common issue where
collected legends are centered rather than spanning the full composition.

When \code{span} is an integer vector (e.g., \code{c(1, 2)}), the legend
is centered between those specific rows (for right/left) or columns (for
top/bottom). This is useful for attaching a legend to specific plots in a
stacked layout. Row/column numbers refer to the panel positions in the
patchwork (1-indexed).

For cowplot users: cowplot does not have a built-in legend collection
mechanism. Consider using the lemon package for manual legend extraction
and positioning.

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, color = factor(cyl))) +

p1 | p2

# With collection: single shared legend
collect_legends(p1 | p2)

# Place collected legend on the bottom
collect_legends(p1 | p2, position = "bottom")

# Legend spanning full height (returns gtable, draw with grid.draw)
gt <- collect_legends(p1 / p2, position = "right", span = TRUE)
grid::grid.draw(gt)

# Attach legend to specific rows (e.g., align with row 1 only)
p3 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Plot 3")
gt <- collect_legends(p1 / p2 / p3, position = "right", span = 1)
grid::grid.draw(gt)

# Attach legend to rows 1 and 2
gt <- collect_legends(p1 / p2 / p3, position = "right", span = 1:2)
grid::grid.draw(gt)
