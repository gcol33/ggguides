\title{Collect Legends from Patchwork Compositions}
\usage{
collect_legends(x, position = c("right", "left", "bottom", "top"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A patchwork object created by combining ggplot2 plots with
operators like \code{|}, \code{/}, or \code{+}.}

\item{position}{Where to place the collected legends. One of \code{"right"}
(default), \code{"left"}, \code{"bottom"}, or \code{"top"}.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object with legends collected.
}
\description{
Collects legends from multiple plots in a patchwork composition into a single
legend area. This is a convenience wrapper around patchwork's guide
collection functionality.
}
\details{
This function requires the patchwork package. If patchwork is not installed,
an informative error is raised.

For cowplot users: cowplot does not have a built-in legend collection
mechanism. Consider using \code{\link[cowplot]{get_legend}} to extract legends
manually and \code{\link[cowplot]{plot_grid}} to arrange them. Alternatively,
use patchwork for automatic legend collection.

library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()

# Without collection: each plot has its own legend
p1 | p2

# With collection: single shared legend
collect_legends(p1 | p2)

# Place collected legend on the bottom
collect_legends(p1 | p2, position = "bottom")
