\title{Auto-fit Legend to Plot Height}
\usage{
legend_auto_fit(plot, max_ratio = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot}{A ggplot object.}

\item{max_ratio}{Maximum ratio of legend height to panel height before
wrapping is triggered. Default is 0.95 (95\\% of panel height).}
}
\value{
A modified ggplot object with adjusted legend layout.
}
\description{
Measures the legend height relative to the plot panel and automatically
wraps the legend into multiple columns if it would overflow. This function
must be called on a complete ggplot object, not added with \code{+}.
}
\details{
This function builds the plot to measure actual dimensions, then rebuilds
with an appropriate number of legend rows if the legend is too tall.
It's particularly useful after applying \code{legend_style(angle = 90)}
which can cause legends to exceed the plot height.

Because this requires building the plot twice, it has a small performance
cost. For static plots this is negligible.
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)

# Legend with rotated text that might overflow
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  legend_style(angle = 90)

# Auto-fit will wrap if needed
legend_auto_fit(p)
